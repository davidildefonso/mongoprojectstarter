# NODE MONGO EXPRESS MOCHA  STARTER PROJECT

This is a starter project

## ‚úîÔ∏è Requirements

Node (versions `16.X.X` are tested,  other versions _might_ not work ) and npm. 

## üöÄ Getting started

1. Clone this repository and run `npm install` in the directory

2.  Create a file `.env`  and copy the contents of the `.env.template` file there. In the `.env` file, replace the value of the environment variables accordingly.

4. Run `npm run build`.

5. **(Optional)** To populate the database with some seed data you can run `npm run seed:run`. **Note:** running this command will remove all existing data.

## ‚ùì FAQ

- **How to reset the database?** If you are absolutely sure that you want to remove _all_ the existing data, just remove the `database.sqlite` file in the `rate-repository-api` directory and run `npm run build`. You can run `npm run seed:run` to initialize the new database with seed data.

- **How to backup the database?** Make sure you have mongo database tools installed. Next run the following script with your correct information to make a local copy of the remote database:

	mongodump --uri "mongodb+srv://<databaseuser>:<databasepassword>@cluster0.r0mb0.mongodb.net/<databasename>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"  --archive=<outputfile> --db=<databasename>

To restore a backup or to upload a copy for testing use the following script:

	mongorestore  --uri "mongodb+srv://<databaseuser>:<databasepassword>@cluster0.r0mb0.mongodb.net/<databasename>?retryWrites=true&w=majority" --archive=<localfile> --nsFrom="<localfile>.*" --nsTo='<newremotedatabase>.*'
